      <p>
        Hello there! My name is Alfred, but you can call me Al. When I'm not
        dealing with code or reading, you'll most likely find me either trying
        or modifying a recipe, volunteering somewhere, enjoying a
        sci-fi show or film, or looking for a good rush that doesn't
        involve bugs and a hard deadline.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Most of these activities will be conducted with background music and/or coffee.</p>
      <br />
