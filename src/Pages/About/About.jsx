        I enjoy creating front and back-end components that integrate
        seamlessly over a nice cup of coffee, and sometimes with some music
        playing in the background.

        Among my positive qualities, my curiosity ranks high. It's the reason I can't walk away from something new without learning it or attempting to do it, and it's the reason I took an interest in programming.

        When I'm not dealing with code or reading, you'll most likely find me
        either trying or modifying a recipe, volunteering somewhere, enjoying a
        sci-fi show or film, or looking for a good rush that doesn't involve
        bugs and a hard deadline.
